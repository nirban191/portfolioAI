# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Test in 5 Minutes

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 min)

```bash
cd /Users/nirbanbiswas/Desktop/100x/code/hackathon

# Install all Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Set Up Supabase Database (2 min)

1. Go to your Supabase project: [https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ngplmgtrlkhgkkgibymq](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ngplmgtrlkhgkkgibymq)

2. Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

3. Click "New Query"

4. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `schema.sql` and paste into the editor

5. Click "Run" (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

6. Wait for "Success" message

7. **Create Storage Buckets:**
   - Click "Storage" in left sidebar
   - Click "New bucket"
   - Name: `resumes`, Make it **Private**, Click "Create"
   - Click "New bucket" again
   - Name: `portfolios`, Make it **Public**, Click "Create"

## Step 3: Run the App (1 min)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open at `http://localhost:8501` automatically.

## Step 4: Test Core Features

### Test Resume Upload

1. You'll see the landing page with 3 input options
2. Click the file uploader in the first column
3. **Need a test resume?** Use one of these:
   - Your own resume PDF
   - Or create a simple test resume with any text editor

4. Click "üé® Generate Portfolio"
5. Watch the progress bar (takes 20-40 seconds):
   - Parsing resume...
   - Generating portfolio...
   - Creating resume files...

6. You'll be redirected to the dashboard
7. **Download your files:**
   - Click "‚¨áÔ∏è Download Portfolio HTML"
   - Click "‚¨áÔ∏è Download PDF"
   - Click "‚¨áÔ∏è Download DOCX"

8. Open the portfolio.html file in your browser to see your generated site!

### Test LinkedIn Import (Optional)

1. Click "üîô Start Over"
2. Paste a LinkedIn URL: `linkedin.com/in/yourname`
3. Click "üé® Generate Portfolio"

**Note**: LinkedIn often blocks automated requests. If it fails, that's expected - just use resume upload instead.

## üéâ Success Indicators

‚úÖ **Working correctly if you see:**
- Progress bar completes without errors
- Dashboard shows your name
- Portfolio HTML downloads successfully
- Resume PDF and DOCX download successfully
- Quick stats show your work experience, skills, projects counts

‚ùå **Common issues:**

**"Failed to initialize services"**
- Check that `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify Supabase credentials are correct

**"Could not extract text from PDF"**
- Try a different resume format
- Make sure PDF is text-based (not scanned image)

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Wait a few minutes (Groq free tier has limits)
- Or upgrade to Groq paid tier

## üìä What Just Happened?

1. **AI parsed your resume** using Groq's Llama 3.1 8B model
2. **Extracted structured data** (name, skills, work history, projects, education)
3. **Generated a portfolio website** with AI (responsive HTML/CSS)
4. **Created ATS-optimized resumes** in PDF and DOCX formats
5. **Stored everything** in Supabase (if you had created an account)

## üöÄ Next: Try Additional Features

- Job Alerts (UI mockup)
- Career Coach (UI mockup)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Check Logs

If something fails, check the terminal where you ran `streamlit run app.py` for error messages.

### Test Supabase Connection

```python
python
>>> from utils.supabase_client import get_supabase_client
>>> client = get_supabase_client()
>>> print("‚úÖ Supabase connected!")
```

### Test Groq API

```python
python
>>> from utils.groq_client import get_groq_client
>>> client = get_groq_client()
>>> result = client.call_api("You are helpful", "Say hello", model="8b")
>>> print(result)
```

### Check File Permissions

```bash
ls -la utils/
ls -la assets/
ls -la prompts/
```

All Python files should have read permissions.
